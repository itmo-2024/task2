                A long time ago, in the quietest and calmest corners of the school of magic, the Eared Badger settled.
                But he was not ordinary badger! His ears could stretch to incredible sizes and lift anyone who stood
                nearby into the air. One day, Badger decided to test his abilities and help the students cope
                with their fears.
            </p>
            <p>
                One evening, when rumors about the terrible Borderus Radius were circulating around the school, the
                students hid in the corners, thinking that the monster is somewhere nearby. But as soon as the Eared
                Badger appeared, his huge, flying ears began to circle around the students, and all their fears
                disappeared.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="story-text-second-column">
            <p>
                The badger made them laugh until they cried, dancing with airy ears and doing tricks
                that baffled even the strictest professors.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the students, named Tim, asked Badger: “How are you not afraid of Borderus?” To which the Eared
                Badger cheerfully replied: “Well, if I can fly on my ears, then I can certainly fly around any villain!”
            </p>
            <p>
                Since then, the students of the school knew: as long as the Eared Badger is with them, they are not
                afraid of any Borderus Radius. Every night they now fell asleep to the sounds of flying ears,
                laughing and forgetting about their fears.
            </p>
            <p>
                So the cheerful Badger became the hero of the school, and everyone forgot about Borderus.

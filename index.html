                        <span>R</span>ussian-born Telegram boss Pavel Durov was released on bail
                        after being placed under formal investigation by French authorities following
                        his arrest as part of a probe related to illegal content carried on his messaging app.
                    </p>

                    <p class="default-text">
                        Durov was freed after paying a â‚¬5 million deposit and instructed not to leave France.
                        The Kremlin, which is closely watching the case, emphasised his status as a Russian
                        citizen and warned against <q>political persecution</q>.
                        Russian-born Durov, dressed in black and wearing dark glasses, walked briskly out of
                        the Paris court house late Wednesday into a waiting car after being charged out but
                        allowed to go free under judicial supervision.<br><br>
                        Durov, 39, was charged on several counts of failing to curb extremist and illegal
                        content on the popular messaging app which now has over 900 million followers but
                        has become increasingly controversial.
                        His lawyer David-Olivier Kaminski said it was <q>absurd</q> to suggest Durov could be
                        implicated in any crime committed on the app, adding: <q>Telegram complies in all
                        respects with European rules concerning digital technology.</q><br><br>
                        In Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned France against turning the case
                        into <q>political persecution</q>, emphasising he is a <q>Russian citizen</q> and <q>we will
                        be watching what happens next.</q>
                        Among those also voicing support for Durov is fellow tech tycoon and chief
                        executive of X, Elon Musk, who has posted comments under the hashtag #FreePavel.
